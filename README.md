## Usage 

Click the colored middle row to input text into the appropriate hour. Once you're satisifed with the details of your event click on the blue save area (specifically the image of the floppy disk), to save your information for future refrence. If you refresh the page on your current browser your information will be saved and be updatable throughout your workday. PLEASE NOTE: if you open this scheduler in a different browser it will not save your information.

## Future Updates

This application is a work in progress, future updates will include: 

1. Being able to access any day of the year
2. Styling floppy icon to be the same size as the blue division of each row
